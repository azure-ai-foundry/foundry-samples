# HelloWorld

A minimal "hello world" hosted agent using the [Agent Framework](https://github.com/microsoft/agent-framework) with the Responses protocol in C#. This is the recommended starting point for understanding how agents are hosted on Foundry.

## Running the Agent Host

Follow the instructions in the [Running the Agent Host Locally](../README.md#running-the-agent-host-locally) section of the parent README to run the agent host.

## Interacting with the agent

> Depending on how you run the agent host, you can invoke the agent using `curl` (`Invoke-WebRequest` in PowerShell), `azd`, or the **Agent Inspector** in the Foundry Toolkit VS Code extension. Please refer to the [parent README](../README.md) for more details. Use this README for sample queries you can send to the agent.

Send a request to the agent:

```bash
azd ai agent invoke --local "What is Microsoft Foundry?"
```

Or use `curl`:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8088/responses -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"input": "What is Microsoft Foundry?", "stream": false}'
```

The server will respond with a JSON object containing the response text and a response ID. You can use this response ID to continue the conversation in subsequent requests.

### Multi-turn conversation

To have a multi-turn conversation with the agent, include the previous response id in the request body:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8088/responses -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"input": "Can you summarize that?", "previous_response_id": "REPLACE_WITH_PREVIOUS_RESPONSE_ID", "stream": false}'
```

### Test in Agent Inspector

Once the agent is running locally, open **Agent Inspector** in VS Code (Command Palette: **Foundry Toolkit: Open Agent Inspector**) to interactively send messages and view responses.

Type the following message in Inspector:

```
What is Microsoft Foundry?
```

## Deploying the Agent to Foundry

To deploy the agent to Foundry, follow the instructions in the [Deploying the Agent to Foundry](../README.md#deploying-the-agent-to-foundry) section of the parent README.

### Deploying with the Foundry Toolkit VS Code Extension

1. Open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`) and run **Foundry Toolkit: Deploy Hosted Agent**. The extension opens a tab-based **Deploy Hosted Agent** wizard and reads `agent.yaml` to auto-populate what it can.
2. If prompted, complete **Foundry Project Setup** to pick the subscription and Foundry project (or create a new one) to deploy to.
3. On the **Basics** tab, configure the core deployment settings:
   - **Deployment Method**: **Code** (upload as a ZIP) or **Container** (Docker image via ACR).
   - For **Code**, pick a packaging option: **Remote** or **Local**.
   - For **Container**, pick a registry option: default ACR, your own ACR, or a prebuilt ACR image.
   - **Hosted Agent Name**: confirm the name to register with the hosting service.
4. On the **Review + Deploy** tab, finalize the runtime and resources:
   - Confirm the auto-detected runtime details (language, entry point, or Dockerfile).
   - Pick a **CPU and Memory** size.
   - Click **Deploy**. Fields are validated inline, and the extension handles the build/upload, agent version creation, and RBAC role assignment.
5. After deployment, invoke the agent in the Agent Playground and stream live logs from the **Logs** tab.
